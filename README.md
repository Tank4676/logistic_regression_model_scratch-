# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements logistic regression using only **NumPy** and **Pandas** — no scikit-learn. It performs **binary classification** to detect whether a flower is *Iris-setosa* or not, based on the Iris dataset.

## Features
- Feature normalization
- Manual sigmoid activation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent optimizer
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Loss curve visualization with Matplotlib

##  Files
- `logistic_regression.py` – Main model code
- `iris.data` – Dataset (place in same folder)
- `README.md` – Project overview
